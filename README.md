## Features
- Smooth and realistic falling code effect
- Customizable speed, density, and colors
- Developed in C# using .NET
- Lightweight and efficient
- Console-based animation

## Usage
1. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
2. Build and run the application.
3. Enjoy the falling code effect!

## Technical Details
The project consists of several key components:

### `MatrixRain.Engine.MatrixEngine`
- The main entry point of the application.
- Initializes the rendering engine and starts the animation loop.

### `MatrixRain.Renderer.RainRenderer`
- Handles the rendering of the falling code effect.
- Manages an array of `Column` objects that update their position over time.

### `MatrixRain.Models.Column`
- Represents a vertical column of falling characters.
- Uses `RandomHelper` to generate random characters and lengths.
- Updates the console output to simulate the rain effect.

### `MatrixRain.Utils.RandomHelper`
- Provides helper methods for generating random values.
- Used for determining column lengths and random character selection.
